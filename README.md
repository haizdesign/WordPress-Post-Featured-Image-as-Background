# WordPress Post Featured Image as Background
Displays a list of 3 posts and applies a unique class to each post. For the first post, it sets the featured image as the post container background. If the featured image has not been set, it uses a fallback image.

## Note
The path for the fallback image  looks in the theme directory - check lines 19/20
